# Pave the Way App

## Installation

To install run `npm install`

## Running the app

To run the app run `npm start`

### Patterns used

As this is a React app, the main design pattern that we used is the "State pattern". When the search field is changed, the state of the Dashboard component also changes and therefore the Virtual DOM is rerendered.

## Work 2

The front end has UI tests to make sure the user is getting the proper experience.
